- Explains all verb forms and how they are formed and conjugated
- For each verb form, lists sentence patterns
- Contains exercises
- Explanations are quite short (more space is given to example sentences and exercises)
- Appendix with overview of sentence patterns and long verb list (including suru verbs)
- The sentence patterns are probably the most useful feature of the book
  - Similar to [Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication](#japanese-sentence-patterns-for-effective-communication) and [A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns](#a-dictionary-of-basic-japanese-sentence-patterns), however, it contains more advanced patterns than these two books, which are formed through certain advanced verb forms.
