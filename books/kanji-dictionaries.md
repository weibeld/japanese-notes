## The Kodansha Kanji Dictionary

‚úÖ Pros:

- **Info:** a lot of useful data points like the kanji's radical, J≈çy≈ç grade, and Unicode code point
- **Structure:** entries are very well structured into various sections, including usage, synonyms, etc.

‚ùå Cons:

- **Ordering:** SKIP method instead of radicals, thus no direct lookup by radical possible (however, there is a radical index with the 214 Kangxi radicals)
- **Readability:** columns in entries are not justified and cramped together and lack contrast, hard to parse
- **Format:** huge, hardcover

üü° Neutral:

- **Scripts:** words and compounds in kanji, kana, and romaji, however, kana is always hiragana, even for on-yomi readings, readings of the kanji itself only in kana (no romaji)

#### Ordering

- Restoring of the traditional 214 radical system  (i.e. definition of the same radicals for all kanji as in the Kangxi dictionary) with respect to the former Radical Priority System of [The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary](the-modern-readers-japaneseenglish-character-dictionary)
- In favour of the Radical Priority System of the predecessor version [The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary](the-modern-readers-japaneseenglish-character-dictionary).
- This is supposed to resemble more closely the traditional 214 Kangxi radical system (i.e. which component is the radical of each kanji)
- Contains Universal Radical Index
  - Index where each kanji is under all the graphemes that one might suspect to be its radical

#### Notes

- Predecessor of [The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary (1997)](#the-new-nelson-japaneseenglish-character-dictionary) above
- Last dictionary to use the Radical Priority System by Nelson before it has been abandoned in favour of the traditional 214 Kangxi radical system in [The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary](#the-new-nelson-japaneseenglish-character-dictionary).

#### Ordering:

- 214 radicals according to the Radical Priority System, which differs from the traditional radical system
  - 12% of characters have different radicals than in the traditional Kangxi system (page 9)
  - Radical Priority System claims that it allows identifying radicals more easily

#### Lookup

- 214 Kangxi radicals
- Radical list in page margin with marker including additional stroke count
- No coloured page tabs
- Variants of radicals listed together with parent radicals and included in margin radical string (marker is a bracket spanning the radical and all its variants)
- No in-dictionary overviews of kanji per radical (as in Hadamitzky)
- Index with radicals ordered by the position in which they occur in the kanji (left, top, etc.)
  - Makes it easier to find the radical under which the kanji is indexed (the parent radical) after identifying the radical

#### Readability

- Radical sections clearly marked with enough contrast
- Kanji sections headed by large print of the kanji which provides sufficient contrast
- Two columns per page
- Columns in entries not strictly justified, but sufficiently redable
- Compounds do _not_ include the kanji which impedes recognition of the compounds
  - For same reason, only inludes compounds where the kanji appears as the first character
- No layout distinctions between compounds using the kanji in on-yomi and kun-yomi
- Not enough contrast between on-yomi, kun-yomi, and meanings

#### Info

- Japanese and English name for each radical, including its variants
- Stroke order: no

#### Scripts

- Kanji and romaji (no kana)
- On-yomi in upper-case romaji and kun-yomi in lower-case italics

#### Indexes

- Kanji list
